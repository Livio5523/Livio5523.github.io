                <p class="introduction introductionDesktop">
                    My name is Livio Paupe, I was born in 2003 and I'm currently doing a Bachelor's degree in animation at HSLU, the Lucerne School of Art and Design. 
                    <br /><br />
                    Before that, I did a foundation year at ECAL, the cantonal art school in Lausanne, specialising in media and interaction design.
                    <br /><br />
                    I'm passionate about art, design, animation and video games. I love travelling to fantastic worlds and meeting new characters. 
                    For me, the most important thing in a work of art is immersion. I want to create my own universe and share it with the rest of the world.
